/**
 * Creating a complete payment gateway requires several components and steps beyond just a simple code snippet. However, I can provide you with a basic outline and example code to get you started with setting up a payment gateway using PHP and Stripe.
 * Setting Up Stripe Account:
 * First, you need to create an account on Stripe (https://stripe.com) and obtain your API keys (publishable and secret).
 * Install Stripe PHP Library:
 * 
 * composer require stripe/stripe-php
 * 
 * You need to install the Stripe PHP library using Composer. If you haven't already, install Composer and run this command in your project directory:
 *  Create a Payment Form:
 * Create an HTML form to collect payment information from the user. This form will usually include fields for card number, expiration date, CVV, and possibly billing details.
 * Handle Form Submission:
 * Create a PHP script to handle the form submission and process the payment using the Stripe API.

Please note that PayPal's APIs and best practices may have evolved since my last update in September 2021, so make sure to refer to the latest PayPal documentation for accurate information.
  *Create a PayPal Business Account:
  *If you don't have one, create a PayPal business account and obtain your API credentials (Client ID and Secret) from the PayPal Developer Dashboard.
  *Install PayPal PHP SDK:
  *
  *composer require paypal/rest-api-sdk-php
  *
  *You need to install the PayPal PHP SDK using Composer. If you haven't already, install Composer and run this command in your project directory:
